# image2pattern
A simple electron app to convert an image to a cross-stitch pattern.

Not currently packaged as an executable application on any platform. To run you
will need to have node installed and running on your local system.

Start the application: `npm start`
A couple test wrappers to aid debugging and development:
`npm run image-test`
`npm run gen-test`

Pull requests and suggestions welcome.
